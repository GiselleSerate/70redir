        Looking for the CS 70 digital queue?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, the grutors aren't scheduled to be in the labs right now. If there are any grutors in the labs, they're working overtime--be sure to thank them! (And maybe suggest that they take care of themselves and go home.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The queue will be back soon!

    <div id="schedule" onload="populateSchedule();"></div>

        (If you're seeing this page and it's actually during grutoring hours, please email <a href="mailto:gserate@g.hmc.edu">gserate@g.hmc.edu</a> so it can be fixed in a timely manner.)
